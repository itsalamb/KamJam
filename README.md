#### Description: 
Mark, Kyle, and myself worked on this mock e-commerce site as a final project to sharpen our skills with node, React, SQL, JavaScipt, and CSS for the most part.
This is a full stack application fully utilizing a back end we wrote ourselves. 
We have a lot going on in this application and I am going to give a basic summary of what we have done in this project.
We used many components to try and split up the workload between the 3 of us and make the code broken up and easier(hopefully) to wade through and understand.
We also seeded our own database and had it running as and api ourselves as the backend. Pulling product data from the api and pulling user and cart data from said API as well.
Splitting up the work between the 3 of us and working on our own branches and pulling and pushing and merging was a great learning experience and really helped lessen the load and made everything that needed to be done digestable.
Bart was acting as our "project manager" and he would come in and ask if we needed anything or help us plan out our workload for the near future.
The things that gave us the most issues was the cart, search bar, and JSON in general.
The styling and vibe of the site is what really sells it and makes it more of an experience in our eyes.
